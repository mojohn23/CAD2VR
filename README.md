# Virtual Reality Development for Visualization of Large, Complex Systems in Aerospace Teaching Applications
The following GitHub repository contains an easy-to-use, open-source Virtual Reality (VR) template created specifically for teaching applications. Instructions on how to download the VR template are included, as well as a slides deck detailing how to utilize the template to teach a VR course.

### Downloading Template

The VR template is contained in [Quick Build VR Template](https://github.com/mojohn23/CAD2VR/tree/main/Quick%20Build%20VR%20Template) directory, and as such, the entire folder must be downloaded. For this, copy the folder's directory and use the [following website](https://download-directory.github.io/) to download the entire zipped folder. Once downloaded, unzip, and make sure to rename the folder back to "Quick Build VR Template".

### Additional Resources

**CAD Education**: Additional educational resources regarding CAD modeling can be obtained from the MIT Open CourseWare's [How to CAD Almost Anything](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/res-16-002-how-to-cad-almost-anything-january-iap-2024/). This course, taught in several CAD softwares (e.g., Solidworks, Fusion 360, Onshape, Siemens NX), introduces students (with both little background as well as with advanced experience) to CAD modeling via reverse engineering, focusing on the design process itself. This course could be utilized to CAD models that could be visualized using the provided VR template!

**CAD Models**: [How to CAD Almost Anything](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/res-16-002-how-to-cad-almost-anything-january-iap-2024/) has made a variety of open-source CAD models available in different formats, which can be freely downloaded and used on the provided VR template. Regardless of the original file type, it is **important** to ensure that all CAD files are converted to the _.fbx_ extension. The free assets generated for this project use the [Solidworks Visualize](https://www.solidworks.com/product/solidworks-visualize) software, which can take a variety of CAD file formats, including _.STEP_ and _.sldprt_. However, Fusion 360 and Siemens NX allow the user to directly export their files with the _.fbx_ extension.

**VR Material**: Additional open-source VR materials, including models and settings, can be obtained from [Sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com/).
